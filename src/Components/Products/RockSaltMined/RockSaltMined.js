                            <p>These mines vary in depth from 100 meters to a mile or more in <a href="rock salt/index.html">SIWA Oasis</a>. the diggers are used for digging up roads,  which bore into the salt. The lumps are then taken to a crushing and screening plant, Before storage, the salt is treated with an anti-caking agent which will stop the pieces coagulating. This ensures that it can be held in local storage depots, ready for use as soon as the bad weather sets in USA, Canada &amp; Europe.</p>
